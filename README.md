# Foxtale Engine
Foxtale is an ECS (Entity-Component-System) game engine focused on performance, 
and extensibility. Currently only 2D is supported, but 3D-support can be added manually.

Foxtale is currently in a very early stage of development.

## Before building
You must set correct reference to MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline in Content/Content.npl. 
This is usually in ~/.nuget/packages/monogame.extended.content.pipeline/{VERSION}/tools/MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll
